browser->server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server-->browser: returns the message in json-string

note over  spa.js
The SPA version of the app uses the 
javascript code it fetched from the server,
it instructs the server to fetch the form-element from the page, 
and to register an event handler to handle the form submit event.
also the code will prevent the default handling of form submit
sending a new HTTP GET request.

then the spa.js makes the same functions as the main.js
in the Notes page. (creates a new note, adds it to the notes list, 
rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server)

the code determines that the data is to be sent with an HTTP POST request 
and the data type is to be json. Then the data is sent as json-string.
end note

note over browser
browser only sends one request to the server,
it stays on the same page, 
and it sends no further HTTP requests
end note

note over server
server responds with status 201 created
and this time the server doesnt ask for
a redirect
end note
